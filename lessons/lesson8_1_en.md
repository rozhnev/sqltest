This lesson introduces the `INSERT INTO` statement, the primary command used to add new records to a database table. You will learn the syntax for inserting data into all columns, as well as how to specify specific columns for data entry. We will also cover multi-row inserts and the importance of matching data types. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to populate your database tables with new information accurately and efficiently.

# Lesson 8.1: The INSERT INTO Statement

So far, we have focused on retrieving data from existing tables using the `SELECT` statement. Now, we will begin exploring **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**, starting with how to add new data to your tables using the `INSERT INTO` statement.

## The Basic Syntax

There are two primary ways to use the `INSERT INTO` statement.

### 1. Specifying Columns (Recommended)
This is the safest and most common method. You explicitly list the columns you want to fill, followed by the values for those columns.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

### 2. Without Specifying Columns
If you are providing values for **all** columns in the table in the exact order they were defined, you can omit the column names. However, this is less flexible and can lead to errors if the table structure changes.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

## Important Rules for Inserting Data
*   **Data Types:** The values you provide must match the data type of the corresponding column (e.g., you cannot insert text into a numeric column).
*   **Strings and Dates:** Just like in the `WHERE` clause, string (text) and date values must be enclosed in single quotes (`'`).
*   **Numbers:** Numeric values do not require quotes.
*   **NULL Values:** If a column allows `NULL` and you don't provide a value for it, it will be filled with `NULL` (or a default value if one is defined).

## Examples

### Example 1: Inserting a New Actor
Let's add a new actor to the `actor` table in the Sakila database.

```sql
INSERT INTO actor (first_name, last_name)
VALUES ('JOHNNY', 'DEPP');
```
*Note: We didn't specify the `actor_id` because it is usually auto-generated by the database.*

### Example 2: Inserting into Specific Columns
If we have a table with many columns but only want to fill a few:

```sql
INSERT INTO customer (first_name, last_name, email, store_id, address_id)
VALUES ('ALICE', 'JOHNSON', 'alice.j@example.com', 1, 5);
```

### Example 3: Multi-row Insert
Most modern databases allow you to insert multiple rows in a single statement by separating the sets of values with commas.

```sql
INSERT INTO actor (first_name, last_name)
VALUES 
    ('TOM', 'HANKS'),
    ('MERYL', 'STREEP'),
    ('LEONARDO', 'DICAPRIO');
```

**Key Takeaways from this Lesson:**

*   The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to add new rows to a table.
*   Explicitly listing column names is recommended for better code reliability and readability.
*   String and date values must be enclosed in single quotes.
*   You can insert multiple rows at once to improve performance and reduce code.

In the next lesson, we will learn how to **Create Tables** from scratch and define their structure.
