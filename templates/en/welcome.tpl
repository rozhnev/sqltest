        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <div class="welcome-card">
            <p>
                Our question database contains {$QuestionsCount} tasks ranging from simple <code class="sql">SELECT</code> queries to complex analytical problems that mirror real-world scenarios.
                Tasks are grouped by difficulty, topic, and the database used.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1em;">Each problem includes tests that validate your query results and any task-specific conditions.</p>

        <h3>Quick tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Try multiple approaches — different solutions can have very different performance characteristics.</li>
            <li>Read the task conditions carefully — some problems require a specific statement or result shape.</li>
            <li>Use the estimated query cost (when available) to learn about efficiency, but focus on correctness first.</li>
        </ul>
